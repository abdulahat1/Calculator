Anna took the knife, focused on the tip of the knife and cut the sugar into cubes of equal size.

The square sugar mixed the milk with the coffee and stirred it slowly. Anna couldn't help muttering, "perfect". Then he carried the tray and tiptoed up the stairs like a clever cat. Anna gently put down the tray on the table without making a sound and stared at George's back.

"It's finally finished. It's the most difficult to refine. The six-month refining period can't be shortened." George was in a good mood when the six-month refining was finally completed.

"I'm sorry, sister Anna, I didn't notice you." put away the blessing agent and tidy up the tools, and George saw Anna and the cold coffee.

"Young master, as soon as you are busy, you will devote yourself to it. This is the advantage of becoming a great wizard. However, a great wizard also needs to rest and eat on time." Anna is relieved and distressed to see George forgetting to sleep and eat in the magical world.

"In addition, the great wizard should not forget that tomorrow is Hogwarts' school day. In addition to the books, materials, clothes, articles prepared in advance, young master, what else do you need to bring?" as a perfect maid, Anna will not forget the most important things.

"Really, thanks to sister Anna's reminder, I almost forgot." the magic moved people's hearts. It took six months to refine the blessing agent. George didn't dare to be a little distracted before Hogwarts started school. Fortunately, he finished it before the entrance day.

"The luggage has been checked before. Only sister Anna needs to take it with you. Otherwise, you will not be able to meet for a long time when you go to Hogwarts." George picked up a snack and mixed it in his coffee, with a serious face.
